2007-08-14  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* comtypes\tools\codegenerator.py: Generate the needed imports
	when COM defaultvalues are used in parameter lists.

2007-08-10  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Add comtypes.client.PumpWaitingMessages() helper funtion.  May
	be used to dispatch COM events in single threaded appartments.

2007-08-09  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Added the IRecordInfo interface to comtypes.typeinfo.

	* If UDTs (structures or unions) in a typelib have a GUID defined,
	add a _recordinfo_ attribute to the generated code.  This allows
	to call GetRecordInfoFromGuids(*_recordinfo_) to get an
	IRecordInfo pointer.

	* Released comtypes-0.3.2

2007-08-08  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Add better support for dynamic dispatch, comtypes.CoUninitialize
	function.  Patch from Belyaev Dmitry.

2007-03-23  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Fixed: TextWrap did destroy the generated code when very long
	symbol names used were in the type library.

	* The IEnumVARIANT.Next(celt) method can now be called with
	celt != 1.  It will return a list of items then; this allows to get
	more objects at a time.

2007-03-22  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* In comtypes.hresult, add the hex HRESULT values in comments for
	reference.

	* In comtypes.errorinfo.ReportError, use the supplied hresult
	value.

	* Improved _NewEnum client-side handling.

	* When a relative pathname to a type library is passed to
	comtypes.client.GetModule(), the pathname is now interpreted
	relative to the __file__ of the caller if this pathname actually
	exists in the filesystem.

	* Fixed several memory leaks and other problems in the BSTR
	implementation.  The previous change that requires ctypes version
	1.0.2 was backed out again because it was the wrong approach.
	
2007-01-25  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	NOTE: This comment is no longer true, see above.
	* Removed unneeded methods from comtypes.BSTR.  The resource
	management is handled by ctypes; this requires ctypes version
	1.0.2 to correctly release BSTR resources.

2007-01-19  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* The comtypes.test package is now self contained, it does no
	longer depend on ctypes.test which may not be available.

2007-01-16  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* comtypes.tools.tlbparser: Sort interface methods by VTable order
	(there are typeinfos that list the methods in a different order).

2007-01-11  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* comtypes codegenerator: Do not hardcode pointer and VARIANT size
	and alignment.  This fixes code generation issues on 64-bit
	Windows.

	* comtypes.automation: Fix size of VARIANT definition for 64-bit
	Windows.

2007-01-10  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* (Re-)Added comtypes.__version__ again, and set it to "0.3.2".

	* Removed assert statements about sizeof() and alingment() of
	generated Structure subclasses for portability to 64-bit Windows.

	* Iterating over COM collections retrived the _NewEnum property
	twice.
	
	* Cleaned up the codegeneration.  Generated modules now have a
	'typelib_path' variable that points to the type library used to
	generate them, 'CoClass' subclasses have '_typelib_path_' which is
	used for registration.

2007-01-02  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* comtypes\client\_generate.py: Make sure that generated modules
	have a __file__ attribute, even if gen_dir is None.  The filename
	part of the __file__ attribute is '<memory>' in this case.

2006-12-20  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* comtypes.client.GetModule now recreates the Python module
	automatically if the type library file timestamp is newer than the
	module.  The actual code for GetModule now lives in a separate
	module comtypes.client._generate, but the GetModule symbol is
	still exposed from comtypes.client.

	* COM method implementations are now found doing case insensitive
	lookup if the interfaces "_case_insensitivity_" attribute is True.

	* Some memory leaks with BSTR have been fixed.

2006-12-13  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Fix the case insensitivity for COM interfaces (client-side only,
	so far): If the Python interface class has a "_case_insensitive_"
	attribute which is True, access of methods and properties is case
	insensitive.

	By default, this attribute is set to True in interfaces generated
	from type libraries, because type libraries generally don't
	preserve the casing of identifiers from IDL interface definitions.

2006-12-06  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Fix comtypes.test.test_typeinfo to work when either IE6 or IE7
	is installed.

	* comtypes.hresult: Add MAKE_HRESULT and HRESULT_FROM_WIN32
	functions which return HRESULT values.

	* Receive events from the event interface plus all the super
	interfaces.

	* When a NULL IDispatch pointer is received as an [out] parameter,
	return None instead of the NULL pointer.

	* Changed the way COM is shut down.  No longer a need to call the
	possibly expensive (or dangerous?) _is_com_initialized.

2006-11-15  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* comtypes.client._events.GetEvents: Catch the exception when
	IProvideClassInfo::GetGUID fails, and try the next strategy for
	finding the outgoing interface.

	* comtypes now has a __version__ attribute.  This is set to
	"0.3.1".  Added test command to the setup script.

	* New function comtypes.client.ShowEvents(source, interface=None).
	This function is useful for debugging; it connects the source
	object to a special event receiver that will first print out all
	the event names, and later print out the events as they occur.

2006-08-04  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Fixed quite some tests to work or be skipped on Windows CE.

	* comtypes\typesinfo.py: Added ICreateTypeLib2 interface, and
	changed the CreateTypeLib function to return a pointer to that
	interface.

	* Added a COM server for testing to the comtypes.test package,
	plus tests for it.  There are still several memory leaks in
	comtypes, as the tests show.
	
2006-08-03  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* comtypes\server\register.py: For localserver, the wrong script
	was registered when the class was not in a toplevel module.

2006-08-02  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Version number changed to 0.3.0, added 'comtypes.server' package
	to the setup script.

	* Merged in a LOT of changes from the upstream version.
	For details see the svn commit messages.

	The most prominent changes are:

	- The strings returned by ITypeInfo::GetDocumentation() do not
	contain NUL characters any more (some buggy typelibs contain them)

	- comtypes.client.GetEvents returns a 'connection object', which
	will UnAdvise the connection when deleted.  In other words, you
	must keep the return value of the GetEvents call as long as you
	want to reveive events.

	- Pointer to COM interface pointer instances __setitem__ method manages
	the COM refcount correctly.

	- Changes in the COM shutdown code: maybe the win32com way of
	never calling CoUninitialize() is the best compromise ;-), but I
	have not yet given up.
	
2006-07-11  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Imported comtypes 0.2.1 into the python.org svn repository.

2006-04-25  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Released version 0.2.1 (svn revision 8).

2006-03-07  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Imported comtypes from the ctypes CVS repository into the
	comtypes SVN repository.

2006-03-03  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* (Repository): Move the code generator modules into the
	comtypes.tools package.  Should be refactored later - most
	important is now that it works again.

2006-02-11  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Merged in lots of changes from the upstream version.  Started
	localserver support.

2005-10-20  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* comtypes\__init__.py: Add logging for easier debugging.  Add
	COINIT_... flags.  Use the value of sys.coinit_flags (when
	defined) in the call to CoInitializeEx, this allows to use
	multithreaded appartments.

	Clean up the lifetime management of implemented COM objects.  Make
	COM attribute access case insensitive (has a large impact on the
	performance, unfortunately).

	Move the COMObject definition in a separate module
	comtypes\_comobject.py.

	* comtypes\tools\codegenerator.py: Don't generate dispid() for
	non-dispatch based interfaces.
	
	* comtypes\client\__init__.py: Add logging for easier debugging.

	* comtypes\persist.py: Remove dispid() from non-dispatch based
	interfaces. Correct the Read method. Hack around the
	POINTER(c_wchar) <-> c_wchar_p problem.

2005-10-11  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* comtypes\client\__init__.py: Renamed CreateModule() into
	GetModule().  Removed the 'modulename' parameter from all the
	function calls - the typelib wrapper alias name is now taken from
	the typelib library name.  Suggestions from Bruce Dodson.

2005-09-29  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* comtypes\GUID.py: Rename the GUID.progid() classmethod into
	GUID.as_progid().

2005-09-02  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* comtypes\client\__init__.py: Can now receive events from custom,
	non-dispatch interfaces.
