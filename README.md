comtypes
========

**comtypes** is a lightweight Python COM package, based on the ctypes_
FFI library, in less than 10000 lines of code (not counting the
tests).

**comtypes** allows to define, call, and implement custom and
dispatch-based COM interfaces in pure Python.  It works on Windows and
64-bit Windows. Windows CE support was dropped since comtypes==1.1.8.
