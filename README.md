## About

`comtypes` is a lightweight `Python` COM package, based on the [`ctypes`](https://docs.python.org/library/ctypes.html) FFI library.

`comtypes` allows to define, call, and implement custom and dispatch-based COM interfaces in pure `Python`.

This package works on Windows only.
- [`comtypes==1.1.7`](https://pypi.org/project/comtypes/1.1.7/) is the last version supporting Windows CE.

## Where to get it

The source code is currently hosted on GitHub at:
https://github.com/enthought/comtypes

An installer for the latest released version is available at the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/comtypes).

```sh
# PyPI
pip install comtypes
```

## Dependencies

`comtypes` requires no third-party packages to run - this is truly **pure** `Python` package.

Optional features include the follows...
- to process arrays as `numpy`'s `ndarray`
- type hints be interpreted by `mypy` or several static type checkers

But these third-parties are not required as a prerequisite for runtime.
