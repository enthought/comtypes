   FranOis for the bug report and max-egger for suggesting the fix.
 * Fix AttributeError when cleaning up safe arrays at shutdown (#83). Thanks to
   mitaa for the bug report and fix.
 * Fix 64-bit ULONG_PTR definition in typeinfo module (#82). Thanks to aparamon
   for the bug report.
 * Add POINTER(BSTR) to supported VARIANT types (#81). This allows the Esri
   ArcObjects library to be loaded. Thanks to Matt Wilkie for the patch.
 * Properly catch error when attempting to cache code to an unwritable
   directory (#78). Thanks to Robin Dunn for the patch.



Release 1.1.1
-------------

 * Fixed backwards-incompatible change where empty strings in VARIANTs were
   being converted to NULL (#68). Thanks to shgohh for the bug report.
 * Fixed npsupport module to fail gracefully when numpy is not present (#62).
   Thanks to kyleMR for the patch.
 * Fixed low-level property machinery in _comobject (#60).
 * Fixed bug where numpy would be imported when using safe arrays (#59). Thanks
   to Paul Moore (pfmoore) for submitting the bug and a patch.

  interfaces (#32, #43). This introduces the ability to index with an empty
  slice, which has the same meaning as indexing with an empty tuple.
* Completed migration to ``patcher`` module (#31).
* Extended NumPy support so object and datetime64 arrays can be converted to
  VARIANT safearrays (#29).
* Extended test runner so it can be run under 32- and 64-bit Python and be used
  in an automated testing system (#25, #28).
* Modified many tests so they run under 64-bit python (#21, #22, #23).
* Removed reference cycle in PumpEvents (#19).
* Fixed safearray test that would fail under NumPy 1.6 (#19).
* Project migrated to http://github.com/enthought/comtypes. Issue numbers
  refer to the new project page.


Release 1.0.0
-------------

* #27: Replaced the ``partial`` module with a ``patcher`` module. This new
  technique patches the underlying classes explicitly. This technique avoids
  the problems with the metaclass magic on Python 3.
* Officially dropped support for Python 2.5.
* #25: Allow installation on non-Windows systems.
* #31: Improved 64-bit compatibility by specifying argtypes for GetMessage.


Earlier Changes
---------------

2010-04-09  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* comtypes.client.dynamic: Added _FlagAsMethod(*names) method
	to the _Dispatch class.

	This allows to flag these attribute names as being methods.  Some
	objects do not correctly differentiate methods and properties,
	leading to problems when calling these methods.

2010-02-23  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* pointers and byref() objects will now be stored in a VARIANT as
	VT_BYREF type.  This allows to call dispinterface methods with
	BYREF arguments.

2010-01-21  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Add a __repr__ method to named_property and bound_named_property
	object.

2010-01-15  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Bump version number to 0.6.3dev: development version.

2010-01-15  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Bumped version number to 0.6.2.

	* CoUninitialize() returns nothing, not HRESULT.

2009-12-22  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Bug fixes for event handlers implemented in Python.

2009-12-11  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* COM servers implemented in Python can now fire events; it did
	not work in some cases.

	* When an exception occurs in a COM event handler, a traceback is
	printed.

2009-11-26  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Allow typelib wrappers that contain 'SAFEARRAY(VARIANT*)'
	parameter types to be imported.  Calling these methods will fail,
	though.

2009-11-13  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* To avoid a memory leak when PyInitialize()/PyUninitialize() are
	called several times, return S_FALSE from inproc server's
	DllCanUnloadNow().

2009-11-05  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* COMObject subclasses can now implement a _final_release_()
	method to free up resources, for example.  This method is called
	when the COM reference count reaches zero.

	* Implement __hash__ method in dynamic dispatch classes.  This
	fixes a 'python -3' warning.

	* comtypes\safearray.py: When numpy is not installed, creating
	safearrays took a very long time.  This is fixed now.

	* comtypes\test\test_server.py: New way to test COM client and
	server.  Work in progress.

2009-10-22  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Support broken COM objects that provide IProvideClassInfo2, but
	not IProvideClassInfo (although the latter is derived from the
	former).  See
	http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=2829887&group_id=115265&atid=692942

	* Fixed a regression from the 0.4 version, [out] parameters didn't
	accept pointers or arrays any longer. Thanks again to Michael
	Eddington.

2009-10-19  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Fix a memory leak in Python COM servers.  Thanks to Michael
	Eddington for the patch.

2009-10-02  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* comtypes\test\test_server.py: Start a better approach to test
	both COM object calls and COM object implementations.

2009-09-09  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Fix returning SAFEARRAY of VT_RECORDs.  Based on a patch from
	Eduardo Arias.

	* New module comtypes.viewobject, contains the interfaces
	IViewObject, IViewObject2, IViewObjectEx.  IAdviseSink is faked.

	* Change version number to 0.6.2dev.

2009-09-04  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* CoTaskMemFree does not return a HRESULT.  Patch from James Teh.

2009-08-19  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Bumped version number to 0.6.1.

2009-08-07  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* When an interface was specified in the call to
	IClassObject.CreateInstance, return that instead of calling
	GetBestInterface.  Patch from James Teh.

2009-08-04  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Added comtypes.CoGetClassObject() low-level function,
	comtypes.client.GetClassObject() high-level function, and
	implemented a pythonic interface to IClassFactory's CreateInstance
	method:

	    def CreateInstance(self,
			       punkouter=None,
			       interface=None,
			       dynamic=False)

	* Added the 'dynamic=False' parameter to the
	comtypes.client.CoGetObject and comtypes.client.GetActiveObject
	functions.  Suggested by James Teh.

2009-06-17  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* comtypes.automation: Support VT_I8 and VT_UI8 SAFEARRAYs.

	* comtypes._comobject: Restore compatibility with Python 2.3.

	* Add the comtypes.IServiceProvider interface.  Based on a patch
	from Michael Curran.

2009-04-30  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Change version number in repository to 0.6.0.2dev.

	* Replace the VARIANTEnumerator implementation class in
	comtypes.server.automation with a new one which should actually be
	usable.

	* A completely new way how localserver and inproc server instances
	are managed:

		A comtypes.LocalServer or comtypes.InprocServer instance
		is attached to the comtypes.COMObject class at runtime.

		These changes keep localserver running as long as
		COMObject instances are alive.

2009-04-29  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* comtypes.errorinfo.ReportException now takes an additional
	'stacklevel' named argument.

	* Add E_OUTOFMEMORY hresult code.

	* Register the InprocServer32 only when running as script or
	py2exe dll, not when running as py2exe exe server.

2009-04-25  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* SAFEARRAYs can now also be created from multi-dimensional numpy
	arrays.

2009-04-23  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Change version number in repository to 0.6.0.1dev.

	* SAFEARRAYs can now also be created from array.array objects, and
	from (one-dimensional) numpy arrays.  This is a lot faster than
	creating them from Python lists or tuples, at least for large
	arrays.

	* ctypes instances like c_int, c_ubyte, and so on can now be
	assigned to VARIANT().value.  This allows to force creation of
	VARIANTs with the corresponding typecodes V_I4, VT_UI1 and alike.

	* Accept typelibs that contain SAFEARRAY(char).

2009-03-17  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Fixed the return type of ITypeLib::ReleaseTLibAttr, which is
	documented wrongly in MSDN.  The return type is void, not HRESULT.
	Reported to cause crashes on Windows 7.

2009-01-29  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Restore compatibility with Python 2.3.

	* comtypes\client\_code_cache.py: Add missing 'import types' in
	comtypes\client\_code_cache.py.

2008-12-19  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Bumped version number to 0.6.0.

	* comtypes.client.lazybind.Dipatch:
	If __getitem__ fails the get the indexed default value, try
	NewENUM.  Implement __eq__ for Python 3 compatibility.

	* Fix a problem with SAFEARRAYs where the contained data was
	released too early.

	* Fix property get handling for FUNC_PUREVIRTUAL functions in
	lazybind.py

2008-12-18  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Fix memoryleak in IEnumVARIANT.

2008-12-12  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Merged changes from the dyndispatch branch:

	    * Add a comtypes.client.Constants class that provides a way to
	    access constants in the type library for an object, even when
	    no wrapper has been created for the type library.  The
	    contants can be accessed as attributes like this, assuming
	    'obj' is a COM object that exposes type information at runtime
	    via the dispatch interface:
		Constants(obj).MyConstant

	    * New comtypes.client.lazybind module.

	    * Implement NamedProperty.__call__().  Extend
	    NamedProperty.__getitem__() and NamedProperty.__setitem__() so
	    that they accept a tuple, which make lazy bound objects more
	    compatible with early bound objects.

	    * Finished (for now) the comtypes.client.lazybind module.
	    IEnumVARIANT instances get a _dynamic attribute which defaults
	    to False.  The values returned from next() calls are retrived
	    by calling ._set_value(self._dynamic) on the VARIANT result.

	    * comtypes.client.dynamic:

	    * Started changes based on ideas from Michael Curran: better
	    dynamic dispatch support, and a way to disable the
	    time-consuming wrapper code generation on demand.

	    * comtypes\client: Add a new 'dynamic=False' parameter to the
	    CreateObject function.  This parameter allows to create a
	    dynamic dispatch object, bypassing the code generation.

	    * comtypes\automation.py: Add a new parameter to the
	    VARIANT._get_value(dynamic=False) method.  This allows to
	    retrieve the current value as a _Dispatch() instance if the
	    typecode is VT_DISPATCH, bypassing the code generation on the
	    result.  The IDispatch.Invoke implementation now uses this to
	    ensure that dynamic objects are returned when possible.

	    * comtypes\client\dynamic.py: Implement _Dispatch.__eq__ so
	    that we can compare instances for equality.


2008-12-12  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Bumped version number to 0.5.3.

	* Added VARIANT support for VT_I8 and VT_UI8 typecodes.

2008-12-11  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Workaround for Python bug: Python 3 cannot handle a distutils
	installscript in the setup script

	* Merged the py3-branch:

	Various changes for py3 compatibility.  The setup script now uses
	distutils.command.build_py.build_py_2to3 when run with Python 3.x,
	and converts the sources into py3 syntax on the fly (in the build
	directory).

2008-11-26  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Added untested code to comtypes.server: RegisterActiveObject()
	and RevokeActiveObject(), plus some flags.

	* Applied a patch from Torbjørn Tyridal.  This allows to
	high-level implement methods in COM servers, and event handler
	methods that have [in] and [out] arguments in mixed order.

2008-11-05  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Add the IPersistFile interface to the comtypes.persist module.
	Add comtypes.shelllink module which contains IShellLinkA and
	IShellLinkW interfaces, plus the ShellLink coclass.

2008-10-29  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Handle coclass pointers as arguments in com interface methods
	correctly.  Method calls will now accept pointers to the default
	interface of this coclass.

	* The Fire_Event() method in comtypes.server.connectionpoints now
	returns a list of results.

2008-10-10  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Import cStringIO, which should always be available on Windows,
	instead of first trying cStringIO and then StringIO.

	* Python 2.6 compatibility: use 'types.MethodType' instead of
	'new.instancemethod' to fix a -3 warning.

	Use 'raise Exception(details)' instead of
	'raise Exception, details'.

	Don't use tuple unpacking in exception handlers:
	  'except COMError, err:
	      (hresult, text, details) = err'
	instead of
	  'except COMError, (hresult, text, details)'

	* Python 2.4 compatibility: os.stat() raises OSError instead of
	WindowsError when a file is not found.

2008-09-19  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Bump version number to 0.5.3dev.

	* Bump version number to 0.5.2.
	Released comtypes-0.5.2.

	* COMError nows prints the contained hresult in hex.

2008-09-18  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Changed the version-checking code that the code generator
	creates.  Reintroduced (sorry, Anthony!) the comparison of
	timestamps, if both the typelib and the generated module are
	files.

2008-09-10  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* In comtypes\_comobject.py, Invoke: Named arguments passed to
	COMObject.IDispatch_Invoke are now (hopefully!) unpacked
	correctly.  This should fix the order of parameters passed to MS
	office (Word, Excel) and other (autocad?) event handlers.

2008-09-04  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Removed the code that compared the timestamps of Python wrapper
	modules and type library files - this approach was totally broken.

	Generated modules are out of date if they were created by the code
	generator module with a different version number; the version
	number is now checked when a module is imported.

	The current mechanism also works correctly for generated modules
	in frozen scripts.

	Thanks to Anthony Tuininga.

2008-08-27  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Avoid double-free of BSTR strings under certain conditions.

	* A NULL handler is now added to the comtypes logger; this
	prevents messages like 'No handlers could be found for logger
	"comtypes"' when an error message is logged and the logging module
	is not configured.

	https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=2066024&group_id=115265&atid=692940

2008-08-20  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Changed the codegenerator to generate 'c_longlong' instead of
	'c_float' for CURRENCY. This is not really correct since the
	CURRENCY value is a fixed point integer scaled by a factor of
	10000, but at least the code will not crash.  Need a test case.

	* comtypes.server.register: Add an optional 'executable' parameter
	to Registrar.register(cls), can be used to override the executable
	image name that comtypes detects itself.  Patch by Michael
	Robellard.

2008-08-15  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* comtypes.client._find_gen_dir() improved (based on a patch and
	helpful thoughts of Stefan Schukat): If comtypes.gen is not a
	directory in the filesystem, or not writeable by users, a new
	directory is created which will cache generated code.  This could
	be the case if comtypes is installed in a directory that has no
	write permissions by the urrent user, if the comtypes package
	resides in a zip-archive or a zipped egg, or if comtypes is used
	in a py2exe'd script.

	'%APPDATA%\<username>\Python\Python<XY>\comtypes_cache'

	is used for a normal Python script, for a py2exe frozen executables
	the directory will be

	'%TEMP%\comtypes_cache\<imagebasename>-<XY>'

	where <imagebasename> is the basename without extension of the
	frozen executable image, and <XY> is the major and minor Python
	version number, '25' for example.

	This makes sure that generated modules will *always* cached in the
	file system.

2008-08-13  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* comtypes\automation.py: Allow this module to be imported on
	Windows CE.  Using safearrays on Windows CE will not work. I'm not
	sure if they are used much.

2008-08-08  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Implement InterlockedIncrement and InterlockedDecrement for
	win64.

2008-08-07  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Bump version number to 0.5.1

	* comtypes\tools\codegenerator.py: Change the order of the
	interfaces in the _com_interfaces_ and _outgoing_interfaces_ list
	so that the default interface is the first one.  This fixes the
	bug that GetEvents() and ShowEvents() sometimes did use the wrong
	event interface.

2008-08-06  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* The repository was moved from python.org to sourceforge.net.
	The svn trunk URL is now:
	https://comtypes.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/comtypes/trunk

	The script that extracted the repository is in
	admin/extract_comtypes_repo. The repository structure and the
	revision numbers have changed; the last revision on python.org is
	rev 65336, this was imported as revision rev 355.

2008-07-18  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* comtypes\test\find_memleak.py: Windows CE does not have
	GetProcessMemoryInfo; disable the find_memleak function because it
	cannot work.

	* comtypes\client\_generate.py, comtypes\typeinfo.py: Windows CE
	doesn't have QueryPathOfRegTypeLib - try to emulate it.  Also it
	doesn't use tha PATH environment variable; use a hardcoded search
	path for type libraries.

	* comtypes\test\runtests.py: Define a main() function.

2008-05-29  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Improved the [in, out] parameter workaround.  These parameters
	are now optional.  Removed the special codegeneration for [in,
	out] parameters in IEnumXXX.Next methods.  Added test.

2008-05-16  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Provide a workaround for a bug in ctypes. This allows methods
	using [in, out] parameters to correctly convert native Python
	values.

	* comtypes/tools/tlbparser.py: When GetRefTypeInfo(hreftype)
	fails, emit a warning and generate a fake type instead.

2008-05-07  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Fixed the definition of VARIANT.empty and VARIANT.null; the
	values were swapped.
	https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=692940&aid=1959722&group_id=115265

2008-04-25  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Replace logger.info() calls with logger.debug() since it is more
	appropriate.

	In comtypes.server.connectionpoints, when a event notification
	fails with an error indicating that the event sink is no longer
	present, close the connection and log a warning.

	The __repr__ of VARIANT changed again to make it a little bit shorter.

	VARIANT instances of VT_BREF are NOT unpacked when the .value
	attribute as accessed. The value instead can be got or set by
	indexing, so the api is the same as for pointer instances:

	  print byref_var[0]
	  byref_var[0] = value


2008-04-17  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* More changes merged from upstream svn 26400, add support for
	implementing (non-dual) dispinterfaces (work in progress).

	* Merge in a lot of changes from the private upstream repository
	26394; mainly much better support for implementing comtypes
	servers.

2008-04-09  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Bump version number to 0.4.3a

	* Released version comtypes 0.4.2.

	* comtypes.util: New module, containing the byref_at() and
	cast_field() helper functions.

2008-04-07  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Fix the codegenerator to handle all kinds of IEnumXXX::Next
	method signatures; the second and third parameters may be [out] or
	[in, out].

2008-03-07  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Implemented support for SAFEARRAYs containing com interface
	pointers.

2008-03-04  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Add comtypes.client.gen_dir to comtypes.gen.__path__ so that the
	codegenerator can import its generated module(s).

2008-02-08  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Hacked support for 'open array' [out] parameters in COM methods.
	These are arrays that have both size_is() and length_is() in IDL.
	See the comments in comtypes\tools\codegenerator.py, search for
	'OPENARRAY'.

2008-02-06  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* The badly named comtypes.client.wrap function was renamed into
	comtypes.client.GetBestInterface.  For backwards compatibility the
	old name stays as an alias.

	* Replaced the comtypes.messageloop.add_filter(filter) function
	with comtypes-messageloop.insert_filter(index, filter).  This
	allows to specify the order in which the filters are applied.

	* Added a workaround for the buggy _ctypes.COMError in Python 2.5
	and 2.51.

2007-12-19  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Bump version number to 0.4.2.

	* Special methods (__iter__ and so on) did not work on
	dispinterfaces, because the __map_case__ dictionary was not
	populated.

2007-11-23  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Released version comtypes 0.4.1.

	* Add a PumpEvents(timeout) function to comtypes.client.  This
	function calls the win32 CoWaitForMultipleHandles() function which
	will wait in a way compatible with all types of apartments;
	additionally this function can be interrupted with Control+C.

2007-11-21  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* comtypes\__init__.py: Add docstrings to special methods.  Make
	named_property a data descriptor by providing a __set__ method
	(which will raise AttributeError when called).

2007-11-15  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* comtypes\__init__.py: Fix bound_named_property.__setitem__ so
	that COM properties can be set that require zero or more than one
	arguments.

	* comtypes\__init__.py:  Restructure the code that extend the COM
	interface subclasses with __len__, __call__, __getitem__, and
	__iter__ methods.  This is done with the comtypes.partial module,
	and apparently had strange behaviour when the code is run under a
	debugger.

2007-11-07  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Changed version number to 0.4.1.

	* Add an post-install script that will (after confirmation) remove
	the comtypes\gen directory containing the generated modules.

2007-11-02  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Bump version number to 0.4.0.
	Released version 0.4.0.

	* In _wrap_coclass, attach a __clsid attribute to the returned
	object. This allows, for example, to find outgoing interfaces when
	a CoClass is returned from a COM method call.

2007-10-26  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Implemented property get, put, and putref with arguments
	in comtypes.client.dynamic.

	* When a COM property has both propput and propputref accessor
	methods, the Python property fset methods determines the type of
	the argument.

	If the argument is a COM interface pointer, or a VARIANT
	containing one, then propputref is called, otherwise proput is
	called to set the property.

	* Allow the creation of SAFEARRAY(UDT) types even if the UDT has
	no _recordinfo_.  Creating instances of these types will fail
	however since no IRecordInfo pointer can be created.  This change
	allows to import typelib wrappers that have UDTs without guids.

2007-10-24  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* When a COM property has a 'propputref' but no 'propput' accessor
	method, use the former in the same way as a 'propput' would work.
	When both 'propputref' and 'propput' are present, raise a
	TypeError because we cannot handle this case for now.

	* Fixed infinit recursion error in __getattr__ implementation.

	* comtypes.dynamic._Dispatch now implements a __setattr__ methods
	that will call to Invoke() with DISPATCH_PROPERTYPUT or
	DISPATCH_PROPERTYPUTREF.

	* Handle DISPATCH_PROPERTYPUTREF in IDispatch.Invoke
	implementation.

	* comtypes.dynamic._Dispatch objects can now be used as VARIANT
	value.

2007-10-22  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* The repr of a COM pointer instance now includes the pointer
	value for easier debugging.

2007-10-17  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Disable the VT_UNKNOWN and VT_DISPATCH safearray codes, they do
	not work yet.

	* More multidimensional safearray tests, bug fixes.

	* Speed up the unpacking of 1- and 2-dimensional safearrays.

	* Lots of refatoring of the new SAFEARRAY code; added a docstring
	to the public function comtypes.safearray._midlSAFEARRAY.

	* For easier debugging, the repr of a VARIANT instance now
	contains the vartype.

2007-10-16  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Changed version number to 0.3.4.

	* Mega-patch: Completely rewritten safearray support.  SAFERARRAYs
	are now automatically converted to Python tuples when they are
	received as [out] parameters in COM methods, and sequences are
	accepted as SAFEARRAY [in] parameters.  Multidimensional safearray
	support still has to be added.

	* VARIANTs can now also contain SAFEARRAYs.  VARIANTs containing
	SAFEARRAYs with a typecode other than VT_VARIANT, Python
	array.array instances can be used.

	* Added a comtypes.messageloop module that contains a simple
	messageloop which allows to add and remove custom filter functions.

	* Removed the comtypes.client.PumpWaitingMessages function.

	* Fixed the codegenerator so that it handles unnamed method
	parameters.

2007-10-04  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Several refactorings and a small bugfix from the upstream
	repository.

	* In the comtypes\gen\... type library wrappers, the code
	generator now creates a commented out template that shows an
	implementation for each interface it wraps.

2007-10-02  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* comtypes.safearray.UnpackSafeArray can now unpack SAFEARRAYs
	that containt UDT (user defined data types).  Patch by Rimon Barr,
	testcase by me.

2007-09-14  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Released version 0.3.3.

2007-09-12  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Bump version number to 0.3.3.

2007-09-03  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Add the partial module, which allows the usual class statement
	syntax to attach methods to already existing classes.

	* Use partial in comtypes.automation to attach methods to
	POINTER(VARIANT).


2007-08-24  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Added a custom outgoing interface to TestComServer.idl.
	Implemented IConnectionPointContainer in TestComServer.py.

	* comtypes.server.automation: Fix the IProvideClassInfo2.GetGUID
	implementation.

	* comtypes.client: Fix ShowEvents(): COM methods must return a
	HRESULT value, not None.  Fix several NameErrors in the
	PumpWaitingMessages function.

2007-08-14  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* comtypes\tools\codegenerator.py: Generate the needed imports
	when COM defaultvalues are used in parameter lists.

2007-08-10  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Add comtypes.client.PumpWaitingMessages() helper funtion.  May
	be used to dispatch COM events in single threaded appartments.

2007-08-09  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Added the IRecordInfo interface to comtypes.typeinfo.

	* If UDTs (structures or unions) in a typelib have a GUID defined,
	add a _recordinfo_ attribute to the generated code.  This allows
	to call GetRecordInfoFromGuids(*_recordinfo_) to get an
	IRecordInfo pointer.

	* Released comtypes-0.3.2

2007-08-08  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Add better support for dynamic dispatch, comtypes.CoUninitialize
	function.  Patch from Belyaev Dmitry.

2007-03-23  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Fixed: TextWrap did destroy the generated code when very long
	symbol names used were in the type library.

	* The IEnumVARIANT.Next(celt) method can now be called with
	celt != 1.  It will return a list of items then; this allows to get
	more objects at a time.

2007-03-22  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* In comtypes.hresult, add the hex HRESULT values in comments for
	reference.

	* In comtypes.errorinfo.ReportError, use the supplied hresult
	value.

	* Improved _NewEnum client-side handling.

	* When a relative pathname to a type library is passed to
	comtypes.client.GetModule(), the pathname is now interpreted
	relative to the __file__ of the caller if this pathname actually
	exists in the filesystem.

	* Fixed several memory leaks and other problems in the BSTR
	implementation.  The previous change that requires ctypes version
	1.0.2 was backed out again because it was the wrong approach.

2007-01-25  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	NOTE: This comment is no longer true, see above.
	* Removed unneeded methods from comtypes.BSTR.  The resource
	management is handled by ctypes; this requires ctypes version
	1.0.2 to correctly release BSTR resources.

2007-01-19  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* The comtypes.test package is now self contained, it does no
	longer depend on ctypes.test which may not be available.

2007-01-16  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* comtypes.tools.tlbparser: Sort interface methods by VTable order
	(there are typeinfos that list the methods in a different order).

2007-01-11  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* comtypes codegenerator: Do not hardcode pointer and VARIANT size
	and alignment.  This fixes code generation issues on 64-bit
	Windows.

	* comtypes.automation: Fix size of VARIANT definition for 64-bit
	Windows.

2007-01-10  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* (Re-)Added comtypes.__version__ again, and set it to "0.3.2".

	* Removed assert statements about sizeof() and alingment() of
	generated Structure subclasses for portability to 64-bit Windows.

	* Iterating over COM collections retrived the _NewEnum property
	twice.

	* Cleaned up the codegeneration.  Generated modules now have a
	'typelib_path' variable that points to the type library used to
	generate them, 'CoClass' subclasses have '_typelib_path_' which is
	used for registration.

2007-01-02  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* comtypes\client\_generate.py: Make sure that generated modules
	have a __file__ attribute, even if gen_dir is None.  The filename
	part of the __file__ attribute is '<memory>' in this case.

2006-12-20  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* comtypes.client.GetModule now recreates the Python module
	automatically if the type library file timestamp is newer than the
	module.  The actual code for GetModule now lives in a separate
	module comtypes.client._generate, but the GetModule symbol is
	still exposed from comtypes.client.

	* COM method implementations are now found doing case insensitive
	lookup if the interfaces "_case_insensitivity_" attribute is True.

	* Some memory leaks with BSTR have been fixed.

2006-12-13  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Fix the case insensitivity for COM interfaces (client-side only,
	so far): If the Python interface class has a "_case_insensitive_"
	attribute which is True, access of methods and properties is case
	insensitive.

	By default, this attribute is set to True in interfaces generated
	from type libraries, because type libraries generally don't
	preserve the casing of identifiers from IDL interface definitions.

2006-12-06  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Fix comtypes.test.test_typeinfo to work when either IE6 or IE7
	is installed.

	* comtypes.hresult: Add MAKE_HRESULT and HRESULT_FROM_WIN32
	functions which return HRESULT values.

	* Receive events from the event interface plus all the super
	interfaces.

	* When a NULL IDispatch pointer is received as an [out] parameter,
	return None instead of the NULL pointer.

	* Changed the way COM is shut down.  No longer a need to call the
	possibly expensive (or dangerous?) _is_com_initialized.

2006-11-15  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* comtypes.client._events.GetEvents: Catch the exception when
	IProvideClassInfo::GetGUID fails, and try the next strategy for
	finding the outgoing interface.

	* comtypes now has a __version__ attribute.  This is set to
	"0.3.1".  Added test command to the setup script.

	* New function comtypes.client.ShowEvents(source, interface=None).
	This function is useful for debugging; it connects the source
	object to a special event receiver that will first print out all
	the event names, and later print out the events as they occur.

2006-08-04  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Fixed quite some tests to work or be skipped on Windows CE.

	* comtypes\typesinfo.py: Added ICreateTypeLib2 interface, and
	changed the CreateTypeLib function to return a pointer to that
	interface.

	* Added a COM server for testing to the comtypes.test package,
	plus tests for it.  There are still several memory leaks in
	comtypes, as the tests show.

2006-08-03  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* comtypes\server\register.py: For localserver, the wrong script
	was registered when the class was not in a toplevel module.

2006-08-02  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Version number changed to 0.3.0, added 'comtypes.server' package
	to the setup script.

	* Merged in a LOT of changes from the upstream version.
	For details see the svn commit messages.

	The most prominent changes are:

	- The strings returned by ITypeInfo::GetDocumentation() do not
	contain NUL characters any more (some buggy typelibs contain them)

	- comtypes.client.GetEvents returns a 'connection object', which
	will UnAdvise the connection when deleted.  In other words, you
	must keep the return value of the GetEvents call as long as you
	want to reveive events.

	- Pointer to COM interface pointer instances __setitem__ method manages
	the COM refcount correctly.

	- Changes in the COM shutdown code: maybe the win32com way of
	never calling CoUninitialize() is the best compromise ;-), but I
	have not yet given up.

2006-07-11  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Imported comtypes 0.2.1 into the python.org svn repository.

2006-04-25  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Released version 0.2.1 (svn revision 8).

2006-03-07  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Imported comtypes from the ctypes CVS repository into the
	comtypes SVN repository.

2006-03-03  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* (Repository): Move the code generator modules into the
	comtypes.tools package.  Should be refactored later - most
	important is now that it works again.

2006-02-11  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Merged in lots of changes from the upstream version.  Started
	localserver support.

2005-10-20  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* comtypes\__init__.py: Add logging for easier debugging.  Add
	COINIT_... flags.  Use the value of sys.coinit_flags (when
	defined) in the call to CoInitializeEx, this allows to use
	multithreaded appartments.

	Clean up the lifetime management of implemented COM objects.  Make
	COM attribute access case insensitive (has a large impact on the
	performance, unfortunately).

	Move the COMObject definition in a separate module
	comtypes\_comobject.py.

	* comtypes\tools\codegenerator.py: Don't generate dispid() for
	non-dispatch based interfaces.

	* comtypes\client\__init__.py: Add logging for easier debugging.

	* comtypes\persist.py: Remove dispid() from non-dispatch based
	interfaces. Correct the Read method. Hack around the
	POINTER(c_wchar) <-> c_wchar_p problem.

2005-10-11  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* comtypes\client\__init__.py: Renamed CreateModule() into
	GetModule().  Removed the 'modulename' parameter from all the
	function calls - the typelib wrapper alias name is now taken from
	the typelib library name.  Suggestions from Bruce Dodson.

2005-09-29  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* comtypes\GUID.py: Rename the GUID.progid() classmethod into
	GUID.as_progid().

2005-09-02  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* comtypes\client\__init__.py: Can now receive events from custom,
	non-dispatch interfaces.
